# 🌟 Welcome to My Personal Space

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for stopping by my little corner of GitHub. This org is where I build, break, and (usually) fix projects across system development, web apps, and Android—all with a focus on clean architecture, practical features, and a sprinkle of fun. 😄

## 🚀 What I Build
- System and web apps with role-based access, smart navigation, and real-world workflows.[1][2]
- Lightweight file-based persistence for quick prototypes and tools (think users.txt, course.txt, etc.).[3]
- Solid user data handling with unique ID generation and file-backed lookups (C++ power! ⚙️).[4][5]
- Android apps in Kotlin/Java, including Quick Settings tiles and accessibility features ⚡.[6][7][8][9][10]

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- C++ for performance-critical tools and system logic.[5]
- Kotlin/Java for Android with Gradle (Kotlin DSL), using modern namespaces and best practices.[7][8][10][6]
- File-based storage for straightforward persistence during early stages or utility projects.[11][3]

## 📦 Featured Projects
- User Management & Auth Suite: Cookie-based sessions with expiration and file-backed credentials—simple, portable, and effective 🍪.[2][11]
- System Utilities in C++: Unique ID generation, fast lookups, and robust data handling ⚙️.[4][5]
- Android Power Tools:
  - Quick Settings Tile that opens Sound Settings on long-press 🎛️.[7]
  - Accessibility-powered screen lock with a helpful widget to guide permission setup 🔒.[9]
  - Android app modules under the namespace: dev.y4z.pixelfeatures 📱.[8]

## 🗺️ Project Philosophy
- Start simple, scale when it matters.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Build features that actually help people get things done.

## 🧪 What You’ll Find Here
- Prototypes that show ideas quickly.
- Utilities that solve small but annoying problems.
- Apps and modules designed to be reusable, readable, and hackable.
