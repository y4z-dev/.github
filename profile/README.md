# 🌟 Welcome to My Personal Space

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for stopping by my little corner of GitHub. This org is where I build, break, and (usually) fix projects across system development, web apps, and Android - all with a focus on clean architecture, practical features, and a sprinkle of fun. 😄

## 🚀 What I Build
- System and web apps with role-based access, smart navigation, and real-world workflows.
- Lightweight file-based persistence for quick prototypes and tools (think users.txt, course.txt, etc.).
- Solid user data handling with unique ID generation and file-backed lookups (C++ power! ⚙️).
- Android apps in Kotlin/Java, including Quick Settings tiles and accessibility features ⚡.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- C++ for performance-critical tools and system logic.
- Kotlin/Java for Android with Gradle (Kotlin DSL), using modern namespaces and best practices.
- File-based storage for straightforward persistence during early stages or utility projects.

## 📦 Featured Projects
- User Management & Auth Suite: Cookie-based sessions with expiration and file-backed credentials - simple, portable, and effective 🍪.
- System Utilities in C++: Unique ID generation, fast lookups, and robust data handling ⚙️.
- Android Power Tools:
  - Quick Settings Tile that opens Sound Settings on long-press 🎛️.
  - Accessibility-powered screen lock with a helpful widget to guide permission setup 🔒.
  - Android app modules under the namespace: dev.y4z.pixelfeatures 📱.

## 🗺️ Project Philosophy
- Start simple, scale when it matters.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Build features that actually help people get things done.

## 🧪 What You’ll Find Here
- Prototypes that show ideas quickly.
- Utilities that solve small but annoying problems.
- Apps and modules designed to be reusable, readable, and hackable.
